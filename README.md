## Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks

In this repository, some machine learning practice work is done to have basic understanding and involving some projects in the end. This includes:

  * [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_15Sept2020.ipynb) (Fundamentals of writing ML code from dataset input to building, training and evaluating the dataset)
  * [Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet Regression](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_16Sept2020.ipynb) (Continuing with Simple Linear Regression program to further analyze same dataset (boston) for Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet Regression Algorithms
  * [Logistic, KNN, Decision Tree](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_17Sept2020.ipynb) - [[Dataset-horse.csv](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/horse.csv)] - Used for classification problems in machine learning
  * [SVM and Naives Bayes](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_20Sept2020.ipynb) - [[Dataset-voice-classification.csv](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/voice-classification.csv)] - Used for higher dimensional (hyperplane)classification problems in machine learning
