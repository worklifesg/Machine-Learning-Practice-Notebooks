## Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks

In this repository, some machine learning practice work is done to have basic understanding and involving some projects in the end. This includes:

  * Day 2,3 - [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_15Sept2020.ipynb) (Fundamentals of writing ML code from dataset input to building, training and evaluating the dataset)
  * Day 3 - [Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet Regression](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_16Sept2020.ipynb) (Continuing with Simple Linear Regression program to further analyze same dataset (boston) for Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet Regression Algorithms
  * Day 5 - [Logistic, KNN, Decision Tree](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_17Sept2020.ipynb) - [[Dataset-horse.csv](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/horse.csv)] - Used for classification problems in machine learning
  * Day 6 - [SVM and Naives Bayes](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_20Sept2020.ipynb) - [[Dataset-voice-classification.csv](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/voice-classification.csv)] - Used for higher dimensional (hyperplane)classification problems in machine learning
  * Day 7 - [Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_20Sept2020.ipynb) [[Dataset-horse.csv](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/horse.csv)]
  * Day 8 - [XGBoost, K-Fold Cross Validation, GridSearchCV](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_22Sept2020.ipynb) 
  * Day 9 - [Feature Engineering - PCA/LDA ](https://github.com/worklifesg/Machine-Learning-Practice-Notebooks/blob/master/Machine_Learning_23Sept2020.ipynb)
